    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <h4> It was a hot summer day in Rome. After searching for something cold, I stumbled upon a gelateria. It was then that I tasted the cool, perfectly refreshing treat. 
    Little did I know that the word “gelato” would become such a big part of my life. After leaving the Gelateria in Rome, I knew I would start my own Gelateria in the USA.
