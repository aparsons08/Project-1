# Project-1
Angela's Gelato
Angela Parsons
Project 1, business or personal webpage. I chose a fictional business webpage. A Gelato webpage that seemed fun to create as I visited Rome, Italy in May of 2018 and the Gelato was the best I have ever had.
There are a few uses to the webpage. There is the address on the homepage, so users will know where to go for the product. There is a menu page in the navigation bar, so that users can see what is offered at the establishment. There is a contact page located on the navigation bar of the homepage where users can submit questions or comments to the business. 
Technologies used are 4 html pages and 2 css pages
Future improvements. 1. Make the submit button on the contact page functional by using formspree 2. Add an order online option to the menu page. 3. Possibly add a reservations option to the homepage for customers to reserve a spot in the restaurant.
